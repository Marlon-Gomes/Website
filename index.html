    <hr class="w3-opacity">
    <p>I work on a branch of Differential Geometry called Twistor Theory, which
       lies at the crossroads of Conformal Geometry (where angles are defined,
      but lengths are not), and Complex Geometry.</p>
    <p> The relation between these two geometries dates back to the 18th century.
      Claims of the equivalence between the two were laid out by Riemann, Klein,
      Poincaré, and others, and simultaneuously led to momentous growth in Algebraic
      Geometry, Function Theory, Topology and Differential Geometry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In higher dimensions, the relation is not so simple. At any point on an
      even-dimensional manifold, there is a plethora of linear complex structures
      compatible with a given conformal structure. On the other hand, globally defined complex structures
      are scarce (and may even be obstructed by topology), whereas global conformal
       structures are abundant.
    </p>
    <p> Twistor Theory, pioneered by Penrose in the 1960s, makes use of the many
      pointwise complex structures on a 4-dimensional manifold in an unexpected
      way: instead of trying to find a most suitable complex structure compatible
      with the conformal structure (as one can do in dimension 2), we study them <i> all at once</i>!
    </p>
    <p> The gadget we use to parametrize linear complex structures is called twistor
      space. It has a tautological almost-complex structure of its own, which is
      a faithful <i> complex structure</i> when a suitable curvature condition, called anti-self-duality,
      is satisfied by the underlying oriented conformal manifold. By restricting
      our attention to anti-self-dual manifolds, we can once again bring the full
      power of Complex Analysis into Conformal Geometry.
    </p>
    <p> Twistor theory bears its fruits in the fact that the twistor construction
      is reversible: there are certain conditions on a complex manifold which
      ensure it is a Twistor Space. Sufficient knowlegde about the complex structure
      of Twistor Space should allow one to reverse-engineer anti-self-dual
      4-manifolds. The challege lies on the fact that complex structures arising from the Twistor
      construction are rather mysterious. For instance, in the compact case, they are
      almost never Kähler, so one expects them not to be amenable to
      the techniques of Classical Algebraic Geometry.
    </p>
    <p> While we have many results asserting the existence of anti-self-dual structures,
      the ones we understand explicitly are few and far between. My work exploits
      examples of Twistor Spaces with just enough of an algebraic flavor, namely,
      those which possess canonical rational maps to the projective plane, to shed
      light on the anti-self-duality equations.</p>

        <p> My teaching carrer spans almost a decade, and includes a variety of
            teaching experiences, ranging from teaching 6th graders to graduate
            students.
        </p>
        <p> At the College level, I had a short experience as a Substitute
            Professor at
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_for_International_Integration_of_the_Afro-Brazilian_Lusophony"
            target="_blank">Universidade da Integração Internacional
            da Lusofonia Afro-Brasileira</a> (Redenção, Brazil) in 2012, as well
            as at my alma mater,

            Universidade Federal do Ceará</a> (Fortaleza, Brazil), between 2013 and 2014.
        </p>
        <p> I also enjoy working with Middle and High School students. I worked as a
            coach for Middle School and High School Math olympiads teams (2011-2014)
            in various schools in my hometown (Fortaleza, Brazil). In 2012, I was
            involved in a project in the city of Varzea Alegre, Brazil, designed to
            bring Math olympiads education to underpriviledged students from adjacent
            rural areas. These projects led to many awards for my students, and
            my role in their success led to a Teaching Award,
            <i>"in recognition of the outstanding work in the preparation of
              Mathematics olympiad teams", </i>  issued by the State's Math Olympiad
              Organization in 2013.
        </p>
        <p> I was involving in mentoring students (virtually) in preparation for Math
          competitions in central Virginia during
          the academic year 2015-2016. This work was recognized with a student-led
          nomination to the distinction of <i> Outstanding Educator</i>. I was awarded
          this prize by the <i> Virginia Governor's School for Mathematics,
          Science, and Technology</i> in 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
            More recently, I've been involved in the <i> Math in Jeans</i> (2017)
            and <i>Summer Math Camp</i> (2016 to 2019) programs, two outreach
            initiatives of the

      <h4> Testimonials </h4>
      <p>
        Every semester, Stony Brook students have the opportunity to anonymously
        evaluate their courses against a vetted set of questions. Since the
        Spring of 2018, students have on average evaluated my work favourably
        relative to the Mathematics Department, the College of Arts and Sciences,
        and all of Stony Brook University faculty. Below are a few Testimonials
        from such evaluations.

              which he could not answer. His recitation section was even more
              valuable than the class time, as he always came prepared with
              specific examples to review. Phenomenal TA, would absolutely take
