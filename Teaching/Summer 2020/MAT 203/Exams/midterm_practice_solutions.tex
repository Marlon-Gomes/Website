\question In each of the following problems, determine if the statements are true or false. Explain your reasoning (correct answers without an explanation will be worth only 2 points per statement). 
\begin{parts}
\part[5] Two vectors in space always determine a unique plane. 

\textit{Solution:} This is false. Collinear vectors do not determine a unique plane.

\vfill
\part[5] Two planes in space always intersect. 

\textit{Solution:} This is false. Parallel planes do not intersect.
\vfill
\part[5] The dot product can be used to detect whether two non-zero vectors in space are aligned. 

\textit{Solution:} This is true. Two vectors are aligned if $(u\cdot v)^2 = (u\cdot u)(v\cdot v)$. 
\vfill
\part[5] Let $r(t)$ and $s(t)$ be curves in the plane, such that neither has a limit as $t$ converges to $0$. Then their cross-product $r(t)\times s(t)$ does not have a limit at $0$ either. 

\textit{Solution:} This is false. Neither of the curves $r(t)=\frac{1}{t}i$ and $s(t)=\frac{2}{t}i$, defined for $t \neq 0$, has a limit as $t$ goes to $0$, but their cross-product $(r\times s)(t)$ is equal to zero for all $t \neq 0$, since the curves are collinear, hence has limit $0$ as $t$ goes to $0$. 
\vfill
\part[5] If all directed limits a scalar-valued, multivariable function at a point exist and coincide, then the function has a limit at the point, in the multivariable sense.

\textit{Solution:} This is false. One counter-example, as seen in the supplemental notes on continuity, is the function $f(x,y)=\frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}$, which has directed limits equal to $0$ at the origin, along any direction, but whose limit at the origin does not exist in the multivariable sense, since limits along other curves, such as the parabolae $y=kx^2$ yield inconsistent results, for different values of $k$. 

\vfill
\part[5] If a scalar-valued, multivariable function is separately continuous with respect to each variable, then it is continuous in the multivariable sense.

\textit{Solution:} This is false. One counter-example, as seen in the notes, is the function defined by 
\begin{equation*}
f(x,y) = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
\frac{y}{x}-y & \mbox{ if} \ 0 \leq y < x \leq 1 \\
\frac{x}{y}-x & \mbox{ if} \ 0 \leq x < y \leq 1 \\
1-x & \mbox{if} \ 0 <x = y \leq 1 \\
0 & \mbox{ elsewhere},
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation*}
which is separately continuous with respect to $x$ and $y$, but not continuous at the origin, for its directed limit along the ray $y=x, x>0$, as $x$ tends to $0$, does not coincide with the value of the function at the origin.

\question Consider the lines whose parametric equations are given by 
\begin{align*}
L_1 \colon  & x=2t, y=4t, z=6t.\\
L_2 \colon & x=1-s, y=4+s, z=-1+s.
\end{align*}

\begin{parts}
\part[5] Write symmetric equations for each line

\textit{Solution:} We can rewrite the equations of line 1 by eliminating the variable t as 
\begin{equation*} 
x = \frac{y}{2} = \frac{z}{3}
\end{equation*}
Meanwhile, equations for line 2 can be written as 
\begin{equation*}
1-x = y-4 = z+1
\end{equation*}
\vfill
\part[5] Explain why these lines do not intersect. 

\textit{Solution:} If the lines intersect then the following system of equations has a solution, 
\begin{align*}
2t & =1-s \\
4t & = 4+s \\
6t & = -1+s.
\end{align*}

However, these equations are incompatible with each other: solving equations 1 and 2 for $t$ yields $t=\frac{5}{6}$; solving equations 1 and 3 for $t$ yields $t=0$.

\vfill
\newpage

\part[5] Explain why these lines are not parallel. 

\textit{Solution:} Line $L_1$ is parallel to the vector $(2,4,6)$. Line $L_2$ is parallel to the vector $(-1,1,1)$. These vectors are not multiples of each other, so the lines are not parallel. 

\vfill
\part[5]  Find the general equations of two parallel planes, $\Pi_1$ and $\Pi_2$, containing lines $L_1$ and $L_2$, respectively. 


\textit{Solution:} The vector $(2,4,6) \times (-1,1,1) = (-2,-8,6)$ is normal to both lines, so it defines a plane parallel to both, given by equation
\begin{equation*}
\Pi_1 \colon \ -2x -8y + 6z =0.
\end{equation*}
Notice that this plane contains the line $L_1$. To find a parallel plane $\Pi_2$ containing the line $L_2$, we have to translate this plane. The amount of translation can be computed by inputing the coordinates of points in the line into the left-hand side of the equation of $\Pi_1$: since 
\begin{equation*}
-2(1) -8(4) + 6(-1) = -40,
\end{equation*}
the equation of the plane $\Pi_2$ is 
\begin{equation*}
\Pi_2 \colon \ -2x -8y + 6z =-40
\end{equation*}

\question[10] Compute the trajectory of a curve whose velocity vector is given by 
\begin{equation*}
r'(t)= e^{-t}i + t^2j + \frac{1}{1+t^2} k,
\end{equation*}
and such that $r(0)=(1,1,1)$. 

\textit{Solution:} By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Curves, 
\begin{align*}
r(t) & = r(0) +\int_{0}^{t} r'(s)\ ds\\
& = i + j +k + \left(\int_{0}^{t} e^{-s}ds \right)i + \left(\int_{0}^{t} s^2 ds\right)j + \left( \int_{0}^{t}  \frac{1}{1+s^2} ds \right) k \\
& = (2-e^{-t})i + \left( 1+ \frac{t^3}{3} \right)j + (1+\arctan(t))k

\question Consider the function
\begin{equation*}
f(x,y)=\left\{
\begin{array}{rc}
\frac{xy(x^2-y^2)}{x^2+y^2} & \mbox{if} \ (x,y) \neq (0,0)\\
0, & \mbox{if} \ (x,y)=(0,0).
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation*}

\begin{parts}
\part[5] What are the directed limits of the function along lines $y=kx$, as $x \to 0$? 

\textit{Solution:} If $y=kx$, then 
\begin{equation*}
f(x,kx)= \frac{kx^2(x^2-k^2x^2)}{x^2+k^2x^2} = x^2\left(\frac{k(1-k^2)}{1+k^2}\right),
\end{equation*}
and the limit of this expression as $x \to 0$ is $0$, regardless of the value of $k$. \textit{[2 points for setting up the limit, 3 points for correct evaluation.]}
\vfill
\part[5] Is this function continuous at the origin?

\textit{Solution:} Yes, it is. The term 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{x^2-y^2}{x^2+y^2}
\end{equation*}
is bounded above and below, 
\begin{equation*}
-1 \leq \frac{x^2-y^2}{x^2+y^2} \leq 1. 
\end{equation*}
Thus the limit 
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{xy(x^2-y^2)}{x^2+y^2}
\end{equation*}
exists, and equals the limit
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} xy = 0,
\end{equation*}
the same as the value of the function at the origin. 

\vfill
\newpage
\part[5] What is the partial derivative of this function relative to $x$, at points other than the origin?
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} & = \frac{(3x^2-y^3)(x^2+y^2) - (x^3y-xy^3)(2x)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}  \\
& = \frac{x^4y+4x^2y^3-y^5}{(x^2+y^2)^2}.
\end{align*}

\vfill
\part[5] What is the partial derivative of this function relative to $y$, at points other than the origin?
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} & = \frac{(3x^3-3y^2x)(x^2+y^2) - (x^3y-xy^3)(2y)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}  \\
& = \frac{x^5-4x^3y^2-xy^4}{(x^2+y^2)^2}.

\question Recall that the polar coordinate system in the plane is related to Cartesian coordinates by means of the equations
\begin{align}
x & = r\cos(\theta), \\
y & = r\sin(\theta).
\end{align}
\begin{parts}
\part[6] Differentiate equation (1) relative to $x$ to find a relation between $\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}$.

\textit{Solution:} By the product rule, 
\begin{equation*} 
\nonumber 
1  = \frac{\partial r}{\partial x}\cos(\theta) -r\sin(\theta)\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}
\end{equation*}
\vfill
\part[6] Differentiate equation (2) relative to $x$ to find a second relation between $\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}$.

\textit{Solution:} 
\begin{equation*}
0 =\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}\sin(\theta)+ r\cos(\theta)\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}
\end{equation*}
\vfill
\newpage
\part[8] By solving the system of equations obtained in the previous two steps, compute the derivatives $\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}$.

\textit{Solution:} This problem can be solved by elimination. Multiplying equation 1 by $\sin(\theta)$ and equation 2 by $-\cos(\theta)$ and adding the resulting equations, we obtain
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x} = -\frac{\sin(\theta)}{r}
\end{equation*}
Substituting this value within one of the equations of the system yields
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} = \cos(\theta)
\end{equation*}
