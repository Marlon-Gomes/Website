                <h2> Summer II 2018 </h2>
                Mathematics Department <br>
                Stony Brook University <br>
                <hr>
                <h2>Course overview</h2>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a course about ordinary differential equations
                (ODEs, for short). Our goal is threefold: to understand how such
                equations come about in Mathematics and other sciences; to
                understand quantitative aspects of elementary equations and
                systems; to learn how to predict the qualitative behavior of
                equations without solving them.<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first part of our course will focus on understanding
                phenomena modeled by differential equations. We will then
                introduce simple qualitative tools to understand the behaviour
                of such phenomena (slope fields, integral curves, phase diagrams,
                critical points, analysis of stability). <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second (and longest) part of the course
                will focus on quantitative behavior of elementary ODEs. Topics will include:
                  <ul>
                    <li> Exact solutions of first-order (scalar) initial-value problems;</li>
                    <li> Approximation methods for first-order equations;</li>
                    <li> Linear, higher-order (scalar) initial-value problems with constant
                     coefficients (the characteristc method, undetermined coefficients
                     and variation of parameters), with applications;</li>
                     <li> Introduction to second-order, boundary-value problems and
                    eigenvalue methods;</li>
                    <li> Power series methods for second-order equations: classification
                    of ordinary and singular points of differential equations;
                    solutions near ordinary points; introduction to the Frobenius
                    method.</li>
                  </ul>
                <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The last part of the course is about
                systems of differential equations. Topics will include:
                  <ul>
                    <li> First-order systems as a way to encode higher-order
                     differential equations;</li>
                     <li> Linear, first-order, homogeneous systems with constant
                    coefficients and the eigenvalue method; </li>
                    <li> Generalized eigenvalues; </li>
                    <li> Matrix exponentials; </li>
                    <li> Phase portraits of 2D systems and stability.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p><b>Required textbook: </b>Differential equations and boundary-value
                  problems, by C. Henry Edwards, David E. Penney and David T. Calvis
                  (5th edition).</p>
                <p> <b>Course pre-requisites: </b>C or higher in MAT 127 or
                  132 or 142 or AMS 161 or level 9 on the mathematics placement
                  examination. For students from other universities, check the
                  syllabi for these MAT courses
                  <a href="http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/mathematics-department-course-web-pages"
                    target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Needless to say, being confortable with properties of derivatives,
                  such as the product and chain rules, is a must. Integration
                  techniques, specially the substitution method, will be used
                  very frequently in the second part of the course. Students should
                  have a basic understanding of operations with power series,
                  and know how to compute their radii of convergence, as well as
                  elementary Taylor series (notably for the sine, cosine and
                  exponential functions).<br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Linear algebra requirements will be kept
                  to a minimum, as we will only study systems of equations with
                  two or three variables. At the appropriate time, we will
                  introduce/review the basic algebra of matrices and determinants
                  (of small matrices). No prior knowlegde of complex numbers will
                  be required. </p>
                <p> <b>Use of electronic computing devices</b>: graphing
                  calculators and computer programs such as MATLAB, Maple and
                  Mathematica are a great tool for this course. There are many
                  activities on the textbook which use such tools, and I
                  encourage you to try them. <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ultimately, however, your knowledge should not rest solely on
                  them, and as such neither will these tools be required, nor
                  will their use be permitted in exams. While you can use them
                  as aid in solving your homework, I strongly suggest that you
                  use them wisely, being mindful of the consequences of becoming
                  dependent on them. </p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems will range from simple manipulations
                of the concepts developed in class on that week to more involved
                applications of these concepts. There will also be suggestions
                of problems that require the use of machine-assisted computation.
                These will be clearly marked as optional.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all problems will be graded, but <b>you
                  should attempt</b> to solve them all anyway, as they will
                serve as your foundation for the problems you will see on your
                exams. Graded problems will be discussed in class. Solutions to
                selected non-graded problems will be posted on this webpage
                weekly.&nbsp; The optional problems mentioned above will not be
                graded, and their solutions will not be posted here.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you would like to know how to solve a
                problem which was not solved in class, whose solution is not
                posted here, or if you'd simply like to go over parts of the
                solution you don't understand, I'd be happy to discuss it with
                you during office hours, or via e-mail. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Due dates will be strictly enforced</b>:
                homework is due by 6:00 pm on the dates described on the
                schedule. If you cannot make it to class (in time or at all),
                send me a scanned copy of your homework via e-mail by the
                deadline (a follow-up physical copy would be appreciated).<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You will also have reading assignments.
                These assignments will complement the lectures, and are an
                important part of the course. They will most often be examples,
                but from time to time may contain theory which is only tangentially
                related to the course (e.g. matrix algebra, complex numbers), or
                applications of the concepts studied in this course in science
                and technology. <b>The content of these reading assignments will be
                subject of homework problems and exams.</b><br>

                <h2> Grading policy </h2>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your numerical grade will be composed in
                  the following way: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Homework assignments: 10% each.</li>
                  <li> Midterm: 30%.</li>
                  <li> Final: 30%.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The numerical cut-offs for letter grades will
                be determined by overall class performance, and as such, cannot
                be anticipated. <br>

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The picture above is a rendering of <i>Lorenz's Strange
            Attractor</i>, extracted from the <a href="http://www.chaos-math.org/en"
                target="_blank">
                CHAOS</a> project, by Jos Leys, Étienne Ghys and Aurélien Alvarez.
                It represents multiple trajectories of points
                subject to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system"
                target="_blank"> Lorenz system</a> of ordinary differential equations,
                a simple model of atmospheric convection.
                Trajectories with close initial conditions behave very differently
                over time, but are eventually attracted to the butterfly-like
                shape you see above.<br>
