                <h2> Summer II 2018 </h2>
                Mathematics Department <br>
                Stony Brook University <br>
                <hr>
                <h2>Course overview</h2>
                <p> The goal of this course is to understand calculus in higher
                  dimensions. We will begin with an overview of linear algebra:
                  the algebra of vectors in two and three-dimensions; linear
                  transformations and determinants; dot and cross products;
                  elementary analytic geometry (lines, planes, conics and
                  quadrics).<br>
                  The second part of the course is the study of continuity and
                  differentiability of multivariable functions, with
                  applications to geometry and optimization problems. <br>
                  The third part is the study of higher-dimensional integral
                  calculus: double and triple integrals in regions of the plane
                  and space, respectively.<br>
                  Finally, we will study the relationship between the
                  differentiation and integration in vector calculus: line
                  integrals and Green's theorem; curl and divergence of vector
                  fields, and the theorems of Gauss and Stokes. </p>
                <p><b>Recommended textbook: </b>Multivariable calculus, by Ron
                  Larson and Bruce H. Edwards (11th edition).</p>
                <p> <b>Course pre-requisites: </b>C or higher in MAT 127 or
                  132 or 142 or AMS 161 or level 9 on the mathematics placement
                  examination. For students from other universities, check the
                  syllabi for these MAT courses <a href="http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/mathematics-department-course-web-pages"

                    here</a>. </p>
                <p> <b>Use of electronic computing devices</b>: graphing
                  calculators are a great tool for visualizing vector calculus;
                  likewise, the use of computer programs such as MATLAB, Maple,
                  and Mathematica is encouraged. Ultimately, however, your
                  knowledge should not rest solely on them, and as such neither
                  will these tools be required, nor will their use be permitted
                  in exams. While you can use them as aid in solving your
                  homework, I strongly suggest that you use them wisely, being
                  mindful of the consequences of becoming dependent on them. </p>

                <h2> Homework </h2>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your assignments are an important part of the
                course (and your grades). There will be four problem sets, due
                on weeks 2, 3, 5 and 6. These assignments will be
                available on this course webpage (links on the schedule above)
                and Blackboard. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems will range from simple manipulations
                of the concepts developed in class on that week to more involved
                applications of these concepts. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all problems will be graded, but <b>you
                  should attempt</b> to solve them all anyway, as they will
                serve as your foundation for the problems you will see on your
                exams. Graded problems will be discussed in class. Solutions to
                selected non-graded problems will be posted on this webpage
                weekly.&nbsp; <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you would like to know how to solve a
                problem which was not solved in class, whose solution is not
                posted here, or if you'd simply like to go over parts of the
                solution you don't understand, I'd be happy to discuss it with
                you during office hours, or via e-mail. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Due dates will be strictly enforced</b>:
                homework is due by 1:30 pm on the dates described on the
                schedule. If you cannot make it to class (in time or at all),
                send me a scanned copy of your homework via e-mail by the
                deadline (a follow-up physical copy would be appreciated).
                <hr>
                <h2> Grading policy </h2>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your numerical grade will be composed in
                  the following way: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Three best homework assignments: 15% each.</li>
                  <li> Midterm: 25%.</li>
                  <li> Final: 30%.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The numerical cut-offs for letter grades will
                be determined by overall class performance (and as such cannot
                be anticipated). <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a measure of encouragement, your letter
                grade may be (positively) affected by your class participation
                and improvements in performance. I will keep records of your
                mistakes in homework assignments and midterms (based on&nbsp;
                feedback I will provide you), and if you correct them in
                subsequent tests you will be granted a bonus (yet another reason
                for you to try solving all the problems).&nbsp;
