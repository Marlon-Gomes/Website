\item This exam contains \numpages\ pages (including this cover page) and
\numquestions\ problems.  Check to see if any pages are missing.  Enter
all requested information on the top of this page, and put your initials
on the top of every page, in case the pages become separated.

\item You may \textit{not} use your books, notes, or any device that is capable of accessing the internet on this exam (e.g., smartphones, smartwatches, tablets). You may not use a calculator.

\item \textbf{Organize your work}, in a reasonably neat and coherent way, in
the space provided. Work scattered all over the page without a clear ordering will 
receive very little credit.  

\item \textbf{Mysterious or unsupported answers will not receive full
credit}.
