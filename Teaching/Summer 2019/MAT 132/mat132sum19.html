                <h2> Summer II 2019 </h2>

                <h2>Course overview</h2>
                <p>
                  This course is a continuation of MAT 131. It covers
                  Integration, an introduction to
                  Ordinary Differential Equations and Sequences and Series.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our starting point will be a review of Integration, discussing
                  the notion of Riemann sums, anti-derivatives, and the
                  Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. We will then move on to
                  advanced methods of symbolic integration: integration by
                  substitution; integration by parts; the method of partial
                  fractions. We shall then discuss numeric integration, involving
                  various approximation techniques. The last part of this section
                  will deal with Improper integrals.
                </p>
                <p> In the third section of the course, an Introduction to Differential Equations, we will begin with a qualitative study of first-order equations discussing integral curves, equilibrium solutions, and asymptotic behavior. Then we will move on to quantitative theory, focusing on first-order equations, and linear, second-order equations. In this section, we will introduce complex numbers and complex exponentials as a convenient tool for solving second-order equations with constant coefficients.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the fourth topic, Sequences and Series, our motivating question is whether an infinite sum makes sense. We will begin with and elementary discussion of Sequences and their convergence, and then move on to a special kind of sequence: a series. We will discuss elementary examples of nfinite sums, whose values can be computed either directly or by integration, without discussing their convergence theory in this first moment. Then, we will move on to Convergence theory, and discuss many Convergence tests. Finally, we will discuss power series, including Taylor and Maclaurin Series.

                <h2> Homework </h2>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your assignments are an important part of the
                course. They will serve as preparation for the quizzes and final
                exam. There will be four problem sets, according to the schedule
                above. The assignments will be available on this webpage. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems will range from simple manipulations
                of the concepts developed in class on that week to more involved
                applications of these concepts. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Homework will not be graded. All problems
                will be solved in class during the week, before the corresponding
                quiz. You are encouraged to try the problems on your own, before
                the problems are discussed in class. <br>
                <hr>
                <h2> Exams</h2>
                <p> This class will have four quizzes and a final exam on the dates and times listed above.
                </p>
                <p> Your final exam will be divided into two parts. The first is
                a minimum competency test. It determines whether you pass or fail
                the course. Students who fail this test on 8/12 may try it again
                 on 8/14.
                </p>
                <p> <b>Missed exams:</b> There will not be retakes for the
                  quizzes. Students who miss more than one quiz will not have
                  their grades prorated. Students who miss part 1 of the final
                  exam may take it on 8/14. Such students will not be entitled
                  to a retake in case of failure, except if extraordinary
                  circumstances prevented the student from attending the exam
                  on 8/12. Such cases will be judged at the discretion of the
                  Instructor.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2> Grading policy </h2>
                <p> Part one of the final exam determines whether a student
                  passes or fails the course (see the note below for exceptions).
                  To obtain a passing grade (C), a student must score at least
                  15/20 on this test. Students who obtain this score are guaranteed
                  a C, regardless of their numerical grade (see below).
                </p>
                <p> A student's performance on the quizzes and part two of the
                final exam will determine the student's numerical grade, which
                will be computed as follows:
                  <ul>
                    <li> Three best quizzes: 20% each. </li>
                    <li> Final exam, part 2: 40%. </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p> The numerical grade will serve to determine the student's
                  letter grade, according to the cut-offs below:

                <p> <b> Note:</b> Students may decide to take part two of the final,
                  regardless of whether they passed or failed part one. In the
                  exceptional case a student attempts and fails part one, but the
                  student's numerical grade amounts to at least 60/100, the
                  student will be granted a passing grade.
