                <h2>Course overview</h2>
                <p>
                  This course aims to make the student fluent in the
                  parlance of theorems and proofs, to prepare one for the
                  critical thinking necessary for courses ahead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our course will cover five main topics: Logic and Proofs;
                  Elements of Set Theory; Relations between sets; Cardinality;
                  Elementary Number Systems. Below is a brief description of
                  each topic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the first section, we will introduce the student to
                  mathematics as a formal language, discussing its grammar
                  (what elements go into a mathematical sentence), syntax (how
                  to structure such sentences), and semantics (what is the
                  meaning of a sentence). Then we shall move on to discuss
                  aspects of this language's <i>deductive apparatus</i>, examine
                  many common inferences used in modern mathematical reasoning,
                  and work on many exercises on proof writing and analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the second section, we will discuss general notions of set
                  theory, such as membership, containment and set operations. We
                  will then move on to work on a specific example, the Natural
                  numbers, as construced by Peano, and discuss Mathematical
                  Induction in its many forms, as well as basic principles of
                  counting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The third topic is concerned with relations between sets. We
                  will study the general notion of a relation, constructions of
                  new relations from old, and properties of such relations.
                  After this introduction, we will study special relations:
                  equivalences, orderings, functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the fourth section, we will introduce the notion of
                  equivalent sets, characterize infinite sets, and discuss the
                  many layers of infinity, as well as the Continuum Hypothesis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, we will study elementary number systems. We will
                  discuss the Integer Numbers and Modular Arithmetic, the
                  Rational Numbers, and finish with a construction of the Real
                  numbers.

                <h2> Homework </h2>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your assignments are an important part of the
                course (and your grades). There will be four problem sets, whose
                due dates can be found in the calendar above. The assignemnts will be
                available on this course webpage (links on the schedule above)
                and Blackboard. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems will range from simple manipulations
                of the concepts developed in class on that week to more involved
                applications of these concepts. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all problems will be graded, but <b>you
                  should attempt</b> to solve them all anyway, as they will
                serve as your foundation for the problems you will see on your
                exams. Graded problems will be discussed in class. Solutions to
                selected non-graded problems will be posted on this webpage
                weekly.&nbsp; <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you would like to know how to solve a
                problem which was not solved in class, whose solution is not
                posted here, or if you'd simply like to go over parts of the
                solution you don't understand, I'd be happy to discuss it with
                you during office hours, or via e-mail. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Late homework policy</b>: homework will be
                considered late if submitted after 7:00pm, on the due date. Such
                assignments will not be granted full credit, with their worth
                decreasing by 10% with each day of tardiness.
                <hr>
                <h2> Grading policy </h2>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your numerical grade will be composed in
                  the following way: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Homework assignments: 15% each.</li>
                  <li> Midterm: 20%.</li>
                  <li> Final: 20%.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The numerical cut-offs for letter grades will
                be determined by overall class performance (and as such cannot
                be anticipated). <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a measure of encouragement, your letter
                grade may be (positively) affected by your class participation
                and improvements in performance. I will keep records of your
                mistakes in homework assignments and midterms (based on&nbsp;
                feedback I will provide you), and if you correct them in
                subsequent tests you will be granted a bonus (yet another reason
                for you to try solving all the problems).&nbsp;
