\chapter{Elements of Mathematical Logic}

\epigraph{Just as the easist bodies to see are those that are neither very near nor very far, neither very small not very great, so the easiest conceptions to grasp are those that are neigher very complex nor very simple(...). And as we need two sorts of instruments, the telescope and the microscope, for the enlargment of our visual powers, so we need two sorts of instruments for the enlagement of our logical powers, one to take us forward to the higher mathematics, the other to take us backward to the logical foundations of the things that we are inclued to take for granted in mathematics. We shall find that by analysing our ordinary mathematics notions, we acquire fresh insight, new powers, and the means of reaching whole new mathematics subjects(...).}
