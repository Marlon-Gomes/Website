                    Conditions and Wall-crossing Phenomena</i>. Below is a                  summary of our goals for the semester. </p>                <p style="width: 790px;">Classification of geometric objects                  (manifolds, varieties, bundles, sheaves) is an important                  problem in geometry. In simple situations, e.g.,                  diffeomorphism classification of closed (compact without                  boundary), orientable surfaces, the classification scheme is                  discrete: there is a countable collection of invariants                  capable of distinguishing the objects in question. More                  refined problems, such as classifying complex structures on a                  closed, orientable surface of genus greater than 0 require a                  continuum of parameters, thus leading to the notion of <i>moduli
                    spaces</i>. </p>                <p style="width: 790px;">These moduli spaces themselves are                  often interesting geometric objects. However, they are not                  always easy to deal with: in certain situation, the moduli                  space can exhibit pathologies, such as non-Hausdorff                  topologies, failure of compactness, and so on. A situation we                  will explore in this seminar is the construction of a moduli                  space of vector bundles on an algebraic curve. The fundamental                  observation is that a generic vector bundle (or more                  generally, coherent sheaf) can be understood in terms of                  simpler objects, called stable bundles. In turn, the set of                  stable bundles has a nice structure (e.g. it has a natural                  Hausdorff topology), which one can explore. We will devote the                  first part of the seminar to understand concretely this                  construction from both the algebraic and symplectic                  viewpoints. </p>                <p style="width: 790px;">In certain problems in geometry (such                  as the classification of bundles on higher-dimensional                  varieties) there are various non-equivalent notions of                  stability, sometimes even a continuum of such notions. It is                  natural to ask how do the moduli of stable objects vary under                  a change in the stability condition. In recent years there                  have been several attempts to try to understand this problem.                  One of them, due to Tom Bridgeland, will be the focus of the                  second part of our seminar. We will describe the notion of an                  abstract stability condition on variety, and the structure of                  the set of such conditions. In Bridgeland's theory, the set of                  stability conditions forms a <i>complex manifold</i>. In                  certain situations, this manifold admits a wall-and-chamber                  structure: there are real, codimension 1 submanifolds, called                  <i>walls</i>, dividing the variety of stability conditions                  into <i>chambers </i>(the connected components of the                  complement of the set of walls); the moduli spaces of two                  stability conditions in the same chamber are similar, in a                  appropriate sense, while the moduli spaces of stability                  conditions in different chambers are different. We want to                  understand the <i>wall-crossing phenomena</i>, i.e., the                  transformations the moduli spaces undergo under wall-crossing,                  and how these transformations affect the invariants of the                  moduli space that one is interested in. We will try to keep                  the discussion as concrete as possible by studying examples of                  such phenomena in classical theory, such as variation of GIT                  quotients and changes in polarization for slope-stability. </p>                <p> <b> Time and location:</b> We meet weekly on Wednesdays,                  11:30 am to 12:30 pm, in Math 5-127. </p>                <p> <b>Schedule </b></p>                <table border="1">                  <tbody>                    <tr>                      <td>Date&nbsp; </td>                      <td>&nbsp;Title</td>                      <td> Speaker</td>                      <td> Reference</td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td>01/31</td>                      <td>&nbsp;Organizational meeting</td>                      <td><br>                      </td>                      <td><br>                      </td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td>02/07</td>                      <td>&nbsp;Introduction to Geometric Invariant Theory</td>                      <td> Frederik Benirschke</td>                      <td> [G]</td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td>02/14</td>                      <td>&nbsp;Projective quotients in GIT</td>                      <td> Marlon Gomes</td>                      <td> [G]</td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td>02/21</td>                      <td>&nbsp;The Hilbert-Mumford criterion</td>                      <td>Yoonjoo Kim</td>                      <td> [G]</td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td>02/28</td>                      <td>&nbsp;Symplectic reduction</td>                      <td> Matthew Lam</td>                      <td> [W]</td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td>03/07</td>                      <td>&nbsp;The Kempf-Ness theorem</td>                      <td> John Sheridan</td>                      <td> [W]</td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td>03/14</td>                      <td>&nbsp;<i>Spring break!</i></td>                      <td><br>                      </td>                      <td><br>                      </td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td>03/21</td>                      <td>&nbsp; <i>Snow day</i></td>                      <td><br>                      </td>                      <td><br>                      </td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td>03/28</td>                      <td>&nbsp; Variations of GIT quotients.</td>                      <td> John Sheridan </td>                      <td> [L]</td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td>04/04</td>                      <td>&nbsp; Holomorphic structures on complex vector                        bundles I</td>                      <td> Alexandra Viktorova</td>                      <td> [S]</td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td>04/11</td>                      <td>&nbsp; Holomorphic structures on complex vector                        bundles II</td>                      <td> Michael Albanese </td>                      <td> [S]</td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td> 4/18</td>                      <td>&nbsp; Holomorphic structures on complex vector                        bundles III</td>                      <td> Marlon Gomes</td>                      <td> [K], [D]</td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td> 4/25</td>                      <td>&nbsp; Variations of moduli of stable bundles</td>                      <td> Fran√ßois Greer</td>                      <td> <br>                      </td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                      <td> 5/2</td>                      <td>&nbsp; Wall-crossing and Bridgeland Stability </td>                      <td> Timothy Ryan</td>                      <td> <br>                      </td>                    </tr>                  </tbody>                </table>                <p><b>References</b></p>                <ul>                  <li> [D] : Simon K.
