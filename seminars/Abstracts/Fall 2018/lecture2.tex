\talktitle{Holonomy representations and Einstein metrics}
%\affiliation{Replace by your university, affiliation or organization}

\begin{abstract}
I will introduce the concept of holonomy, and present structure theorems about the holonomy groups of Riemannian metrics. I will discuss the Holonomy Principle and the Ambrose-Singer Theorem, relating the Lie algebra of the holonomy group to curvature tensors. Finally, I will present Berger's list of possible holonomy representations, and discuss why metrics of special holonomy are Einstein.
