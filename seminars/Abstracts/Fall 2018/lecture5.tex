\begin{abstract}
We will discuss hyper-K\"ahler manifolds, indicating the various geometric structures they support and how these interact. After introducing some classical invariants of these manifolds, we will discuss a number of examples and constructions in the compact setting. Time permitting, we will mention some results in the deformation theory of hyper-K\"ahler manifolds and point out some open problems.
