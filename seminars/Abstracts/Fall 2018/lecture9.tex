%\affiliation{Replace by your university, affiliation or organization}

\begin{abstract}
 This talk will be about D. Joyce's first paper on constructing examples of compact $7$-manifolds with $G_2$-holonomy. The argument is based on a gluing technique similar to the K\"ummer construction of Ricci-flat metrics on $K3$ surfaces. Indeed, Joyce considers certain smoothings of flat orbifolds and equips them with $G_2$-structures having small torsion. Using analytical arguments, he then produces the examples by showing that these $G_2$-structures can be perturbed to torsion-free $G_2$-structures.
