\begin{abstract}
We will use the surgery result from last week to completely answer the following question (in dimension greater than four): when does a simply connected closed manifold admit a metric of positive scalar curvature? The answer depends on whether or not the manifold is spin, as there is an obstruction in the spin case coming from the Dirac operator.
