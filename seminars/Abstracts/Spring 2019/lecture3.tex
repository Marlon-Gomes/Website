\begin{abstract}
In this talk, we will discuss about the theorem saying that for a continuous map $f$ from a Riemann surface of genus $g>0$ to a compact manifold $M$ which is not homotopically degenerate, a non-trivial extremal map homotopic to $f$ always exists. Also, we will talk about one of its byproducts stating that if M is an orientable 3-dimensional manifold with non-negative scalar curvature, and if the fundamental group of M contains a subgroup which is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a compact surface of genus $g>0$, then $M$ is isometric to the flat torus. This talk is based on the paper, [R. Schoen, S.T. Yau - Existence of incompressible minimal surfaces and the topology of three dimensional manifolds with non-negative scalar curvature].
