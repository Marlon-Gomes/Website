\begin{abstract}
A foundational result of Gromov-Lawson and Schoen-Yau asserts that if $X$ is a compact manifold which admits a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature, then any manifold obtained by performing surgeries of co-dimension at least 3 also carries a metric of positive scalar curvature. We will go through the proof by Gromov and Lawson carefully.
